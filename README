STOCHASTIC LANGUAGE MODELING: N-GRAMS

This program takes in a number of sentences from the user and then calculates the probability the a test sentence being produced.

1. The user is prompted for the type of N-gram to use; either unigram (1), bigram (2), or trigram (3)
2. The user is prompted for the number of sentence they will be inputting into the corpus
3. The user will enter each sentence indivually the number of times previously established
4. Finally, the user will enter the sentence to be tested 

The program goes word by word of the test sentence and iterates through the corpus. A count (seenCount) keep track of the number of times the word in the test sentence appears (changes based off N-gram).
Another count (nCount) keeps track of how many times the word as well as n-1 previous words match in the appropriate order.
The percentage is calculated by dividing the nCount by the seenCount for each word and then multiplying the decimals.
